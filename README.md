# FGLM-Algorithm

## Summary

This repository contains an implementation of the Faugère, Gianni, Lazard, and Mora (FGLM) algorithm for term order conversion of Gröbner bases. For theoretical details and applications, refer to our paper: [FGLM Algorithm Paper](FGLM%20Algorithm.pdf).

Detailed worked examples are provided in the Appendix A section on pages 6-8 which correspond to the implementation provided in [FGLM.ipynb](FGLM.ipynb).
